Advertising Module

A basic advertising module with cms module. Looks for the advert type based on the field you pass in to the call:

<?=partial("ad/mpu", array("advert_type"=>"mpu"))?>

will look for an advert of type mpu and a view called mpu. You could use:

<?=partial("ad/all", array("advert_type"=>"mpu"))?>

and it will still look for an mpu type, but the view will be all.html instead of mpu.html.
